command line to run the program:

If both programs run, you should see the output like this:

Thread 0: shared = 1
Thread 1: shared = -1
Thread 0: shared = 2
Thread 1: shared = -2
Thread 0: shared = 3
Thread 1: shared = -3
Thread 0: shared = 4
Thread 1: shared = -4
Thread 0: shared = 5
Thread 1: shared = -5
Thread 0: shared = 6
Thread 1: shared = -6
Thread 0: shared = 7
Thread 1: shared = -7
Thread 0: shared = 8
Thread 1: shared = -8
Thread 0: shared = 9
Thread 1: shared = -9
Thread 0: shared = 10
Thread 1: shared = -10
Thread 0: local = 9
Thread 1: local = -9
Attacker PASSED :)
Victim PASSED :)

Otherwise, only Thread 0 will print out
